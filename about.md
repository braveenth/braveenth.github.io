I am an entrepreneur who is focused on developing technologically innovative solutions for individuals and organizations.

My key interests revolve around assisting individuals and businesses with leveraging technological innovations to meet changing consumer preferences.

Fun facts:
- Started working with electronics and computers when I was 6 years old (2000).
- Created an Active Directory environment with terminal services and Internet Information Systems (IIS) using windows Server 2003 when I was 10 years old, just for fun. Motivation for this project was the result of my fascination with my schoolâ€™s implementation of Windows and roaming user profiles.
